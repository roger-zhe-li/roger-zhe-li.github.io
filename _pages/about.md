* I am now a Senior Data Scientist/Product Owner at adidas Amsterdam, the Netherlands. With extensive (10 years) industrial work, research, and internship experience in multiple domains of data science, I have been doing different projects in recommender systems, computer vision, multi-modality, medical image/clinical record processing, and supply chain management.

* I hold a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on recommender systems from the [Multimedia Computing Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en) of TU Delft, the Netherlands, supervised by [Dr. Julián Urbano](https://julian-urbano.info) and [Prof. Alan Hanjalic](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing/people/alan-hanjalic/). As a researcher I authored over 10 papers on recommender systems and machine learning. 

* I received my Master's degree with cum laude from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english), China in 2017. My master thesis was about computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer MR images, supervised by Prof. Wei Lu. Prior to that, I received my  B.E. degree from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Huimin Yu and Prof. Huiming Tang.

Miscellaneous
======

During my leisure time, I love traveling and experiencing this amazing world. Up till now I have been to 15 different countries and this number will keep improving. I am also a good badminton and table tennis player. Besides, I am a hardcore fan of Manchester United for more than 20 years. <font color="#dd0000">Glory Glory Man United!</font><br />
